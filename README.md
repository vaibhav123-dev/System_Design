# üìò System Design

**System Design** is the process of defining the **architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow** of a system to meet specific requirements.  

It focuses on **how to build a system that is scalable, reliable, maintainable, and efficient**, rather than just coding features.  

> ‚úÖ Think of system design as the **blueprint** for building and organizing software to handle **real-world scale and requirements**.

---

## üîë Key Aspects of System Design

### 1. Requirement Analysis
- **Functional Requirements** ‚Üí What the system should do (features, workflows).  
- **Non-Functional Requirements** ‚Üí How the system should perform:
  - Scalability
  - Reliability
  - Performance
  - Security
  - Availability  

---

### 2. High-Level Design (HLD)
- Focuses on **big-picture architecture**.  
- Defines **major components** and their interactions.  

**Example (Food Delivery App):**
- User Service  
- Order Service  
- Payment Service  
- Delivery Service  

---

### 3. Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Focuses on **detailed design** of each module/class.  
- Includes **database schema, API contracts, algorithms**.  

**Example (Order Service):**
- Entities:
  - `Order`  
  - `Item`  
  - `Payment`  

---

### 4. System Characteristics
- **Scalability** ‚Üí Handle growth in users and requests.  
- **Reliability & Availability** ‚Üí Ensure uptime and fault tolerance.  
- **Performance** ‚Üí Optimize response time and resource usage.  
- **Maintainability & Extensibility** ‚Üí Easy to fix bugs and add features.  
- **Security** ‚Üí Protect against vulnerabilities and threats.  

---

### 5. Technology Choices
- **Databases** ‚Üí SQL (structured data) vs NoSQL (flexible schema).  
- **Caching** ‚Üí Redis, Memcached (for speed).  
- **Message Queues** ‚Üí Kafka, RabbitMQ (for async processing).  
- **Infrastructure** ‚Üí Load balancers, CDNs, microservices, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes).  

---

# üìò Low Level Design

### Defination: 
- LLD involves detailing the system's components, their relationships, and interactions.
- It is the blueprint for developers to write code.
### Focus: 
- Classes, methods, data structures, algorithms, and their interactions
### Objective:
- Classes, methods, data structures, algorithms, and their interactions

## üîë Key Design Principles 

#### 1. Solid Principles 
#### 2. DRY (Don‚Äôt repeat yourself) 
#### 3. KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) 
#### 4. YAGNI (You aren‚Äôt gonna need it) 
#### 5. Composition over Inheritance 
#### 6. Encapsulate what changes

# üìò Introduction to Class & Object in Node.js

## üîπ Class
A **class** is a **blueprint** for creating objects.  
It defines:  
- **Properties (fields)** ‚Üí Represent the state.  
- **Behaviors (methods)** ‚Üí Represent the actions.  

---

## üîπ Object
An **object** is an **instance of a class**.  
It:  
- Holds **state** (fields).  
- Provides **behavior** (methods).  

---

## üõ† How Objects are Created in Node.js?

1. **Using Object Literals**
   ```javascript
   const user = {
     name: "Alice",
     age: 25,
     greet: function() {
       console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
     }
   };
   
   user.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice

1. **Using Constructor Function**
   ```javascript
   function User(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.greet = function() {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    };
    }
   
    const user1 = new User("Bob", 30);
    user1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob

1. **Using Class**
   ```javascript
   class User {
    constructor(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }
  
    greet() {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
    }
    
    const user2 = new User("Charlie", 28);
    user2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Charlie


# üìò Constructors in Node.js

## üîπ What is a Constructor?
A **constructor** is a special function used to **initialize objects** in Node.js.  

- It is **called automatically** when an object of a class is created.  
- It sets the **initial state** of an object by assigning values to its attributes.  

---

## üîπ Types of Constructors

1. **Constructor Functions**
- In JavaScript/Node.js, you can use a **regular function** as a constructor with the `new` keyword.

   ```javascript
   function User(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.greet = function() {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    };
    }
    
    const user1 = new User("Alice", 25);
    user1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
   
1. **ES6 Class-based Constructors**
- With ES6, JavaScript introduced the class syntax which includes a built-in constructor method.
   ```javascript
   class User {
      constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
    
      greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
      }
    }
    
    const user2 = new User("Bob", 30);
    user2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob
---
# Object Oriented Programming in JS!

###  ‚≠ê What is OOPs ?

Object-oriented programming is an approach to  solving problems by creating objects  .

### ‚≠ê 4 Pillars of OOP

Terminologies in OOP

1. **Abstraction** - Hiding internal details (show only essential info!)
2. **Encapsulation** - The act of putting various components together (in a capsule)
3. **Inheritance** - The act of deriving new things from existing things
4. **Polymorphism** - One entity, many forms


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Inheritance

The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. 

###  ‚≠ê Why ?

#### If you don't know what is Inheritance

```js
class Animal {
    constructor(name, color , age) {
        this.name = name
        this.color = color
        this.age = age
    }
    run() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is running')
    }

    shout() {

        console.log(this.name + ' is shouting')
    }

    sleep() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is sleeping')
    }
}

//If you are nub developer you will do
class Monkey {
    constructor(name, color) {
        this.name = name
        this.color = color
    }
    run() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is running')
    }

    shout() {

        console.log(this.name + ' is shouting')
    }

    sleep() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is sleeping')
    }

    eatBanana() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is eating banana')
    }
}

const animal_1 = new Monkey('Simba monkey', 'Brown', 2)

const animal_2 = new Animal('Donkey', 'White', 3)

animal_1.eatBanana()

animal_2.shout()
```
#### If you know

```js
//Parent Class - Base Class
class Animal {
    constructor(name, color , age) {
        this.name = name
        this.color = color
        this.age = age
    }
    run() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is running')
    }

    shout() {

        console.log(this.name + ' is shouting')
    }

    sleep() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is sleeping')
    }
}

//Child Class - Derived Class
class Monkey extends Animal{
    eatBanana() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is eating banana')
    }
    //you can also add new methods
    hide() {
        console.log(this.name + ' is hiding')
    }
}

const animal_1 = new Monkey('Simba monkey', 'Brown', 2)

const animal_2 = new Animal('Donkey', 'White', 3)

animal_1.eatBanana()
animal_1.run()
animal_1.hide()

animal_2.shout()
```



###  ‚≠ê Types of Inheritance

1. Single Inheritance when one class inherits another class, it is known as single level inheritance.

```javascript
class Shape {
  area() {
    console.log("Displays Area of Shape");
  }
}

class Triangle extends Shape {
  area(h, b) {
    console.log((1/2) * b * h);
  }
}

const triangle = new Triangle();
triangle.area(10, 5); // Output: 25
```

2. Hierarchical Inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class.

```javascript
class Shape {
  area() {
    console.log("Displays Area of Shape");
  }
}

class Triangle extends Shape {
  area(h, b) {
    console.log((1/2) * b * h);
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  area(r) {
    console.log(3.14 * r * r);
  }
}

const triangle = new Triangle();
triangle.area(10, 5); // Output: 25

const circle = new Circle();
circle.area(7); // Output: 153.86
```

3. Multilevel Inheritance is a process of deriving a class from another derived class.

```javascript
class Shape {
  area() {
    console.log("Displays Area of Shape");
  }
}

class Triangle extends Shape {
  area(h, b) {
    console.log((1/2) * b * h);
  }
}

class EquilateralTriangle extends Triangle {
  constructor(side) {
    super();
    this.side = side;
  }

  area() {
    console.log((Math.sqrt(3) / 4) * this.side * this.side);
  }
}

const equilateralTriangle = new EquilateralTriangle(5);
equilateralTriangle.area(); // Output: 10.825317547305486
```

4. Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of simple, multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance. JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance directly, but we can achieve similar behavior using mixins.

```javascript
class Shape {
  area() {
    console.log("Displays Area of Shape");
  }
}

class Triangle extends Shape {
  area(h, b) {
    console.log((1/2) * b * h);
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  area(r) {
    console.log(3.14 * r * r);
  }
}

const mixin = (Base) => class extends Base {
  perimeter() {
    console.log("Calculates Perimeter");
  }
};

class EquilateralTriangle extends mixin(Triangle) {
  constructor(side) {
    super();
    this.side = side;
  }

  area() {
    console.log((Math.sqrt(3) / 4) * this.side * this.side);
  }
}

const equilateralTriangle = new EquilateralTriangle(5);
equilateralTriangle.area(); // Output: 10.825317547305486
equilateralTriangle.perimeter(); // Output: Calculates Perimeter
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Method Overriding

If the  same method is defined in both the superclass and the subclass, then the method of the subclass class overrides the method of the superclass 

- General

```js
class human {
    constructor(name , age , body_type) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
        this.body_type = body_type
    }

    getName() {
        console.log("The name of the human is : ", this.name)
    }

    getAge() {

        console.log("The age of the human is :", this.age)
    }

    getBodyType() {
        console.log("The body type of the human is :", this.body_type)
    }
}

class student extends human {}

const student_1 = new student("Subham" , 24 , "Thin")

student_1.getAge() //The age of the human is : 24
```
### ‚≠ê Super Keyword - Types

The super keyword is used to call the parent class's constructor to access its properties and methods.

#### Overriding the Constructor

```js
class Human {
    constructor(name, age, bodyType) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.bodyType = bodyType;
    }

    getName() {
        console.log("The name of the human is:", this.name);
    }

    getAge() {
        console.log("The age of the human is:", this.age);
    }

    getBodyType() {
        console.log("The body type of the human is:", this.bodyType);
    }
}

class Student extends Human {
    constructor() {
        super("Rahul", 80, "Fat");
    }
}

const student1 = new Student();

student1.getName(); // The name of the human is: Rahul
```
#### Overriding a Method


```js
class Human {
    constructor(name, age, bodyType) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.bodyType = bodyType;
    }

    getName() {
        console.log("The name of the human is:", this.name);
    }

    getAge() {
        console.log("The age of the human is:", this.age);
    }

    getBodyType() {
        console.log("The body type of the human is:", this.bodyType);
    }
}

class Student extends Human {
    constructor() {
        super("Rahul", 80, "Fat");
    }

    // Overriding using super keyword in child class
    getAge() {
        super.getAge();
        console.log("The age of the student is:", 20);
    }
}

const student1 = new Student();

student1.getAge(); // The age of the human is: 80
                   // The age of the student is: 20

```
### ‚≠ê Key Points of Method Overriding

1. **Same Method Name**: The method in the child class must have the same name as in the parent class.

2. **Same Parameters**: The method in the child class must have the same parameter list as the parent class method.

3. **IS-A Relationship**: Method overriding only occurs in two classes that have an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

4. **Access Modifiers**: The overriding method can have a less restrictive access modifier, but not a more restrictive one.

5. **Super Keyword**: You can use the `super` keyword to call the overridden method from the parent class.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Method Overloading

Having two or more methods (or functions) in a class with the same name and different arguments (or parameters)

### ‚≠ê Can We Overload a Function in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, method overloading as seen in some other languages (like Java) is not natively supported. This means you cannot define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class. However, you can achieve similar functionality using techniques like checking the number and type of arguments within a single method.


You can't do this in JS

```js
class Calculator {
    add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    add(a, b, c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
console.log(calc.add(1, 2)); // This will throw an error because the first add method is overwritten
```
If you want, you can achieve by doing this
```js
class Calculator {
    add(...args) {
        if (args.length === 2) {
            return args[0] + args[1];
        } else if (args.length === 3) {
            return args[0] + args[1] + args[2];
        } else {
            throw new Error("Invalid number of arguments");
        }
    }
}

const calc = new Calculator();

console.log(calc.add(1, 2)); // Output: 3
console.log(calc.add(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
```


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Access Modifiers


 Access modifier is a keyword that is used to set the accessibility of a class member 

### ‚≠ê Types of Access Modifiers

1. **Public**: Members declared as public are accessible from any other class.
2. **Protected**: Members declared as protected are accessible within the same class and by derived class instances.
3. **Private**: Members declared as private are accessible only within the same class.

### ‚≠ê Accessibility Table

| Modifier      | Parent Class | Child Class | Outside Class |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Public**    | ‚úîÔ∏è           | ‚úîÔ∏è          | ‚úîÔ∏è            |
| **Protected** | ‚úîÔ∏è           | ‚úîÔ∏è          | ‚ùå             |
| **Private**   | ‚úîÔ∏è           | ‚ùå           | ‚ùå             |

### ‚≠ê Example

#### 1. Public Members

Public members are accessible from anywhere.

```javascript
class Parent {
    publicProperty = "I'm public";

    publicMethod() {
        return "This is a public method";
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    useParentPublic() {
        console.log(this.publicProperty);
        console.log(this.publicMethod());
    }
}

const parent = new Parent();
const child = new Child();

console.log(parent.publicProperty);  // Output: I'm public
console.log(parent.publicMethod());  // Output: This is a public method
child.useParentPublic();
// Output: 
// I'm public
// This is a public method
```

In this example, `publicProperty` and `publicMethod` are accessible from:
- Within the Parent class
- Within the Child class
- Outside any class

#### 2. Protected Members (Simulated)

In JavaScript, we use an underscore prefix to indicate protected members by convention. They're still technically public, but developers agree not to access them directly outside the class or its subclasses.

```javascript
class Parent {
    _protectedProperty = "I'm protected";

    _protectedMethod() {
        return "This is a protected method";
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    useParentProtected() {
        console.log(this._protectedProperty);
        console.log(this._protectedMethod());
    }
}

const parent = new Parent();
const child = new Child();

child.useParentProtected();
// Output:
// I'm protected
// This is a protected method

// These work, but violate the convention:
console.log(parent._protectedProperty);
console.log(parent._protectedMethod());
```

In this scenario:
- `_protectedProperty` and `_protectedMethod` are accessible within Parent
- They're also accessible within Child (inheritance)
- They're technically accessible outside, but this violates the convention

#### 3. Private Members

Private members are truly private and only accessible within the class they're defined in.

```javascript
class Parent {
    #privateProperty = "I'm private";

    #privateMethod() {
        return "This is a private method";
    }

    usePrivate() {
        console.log(this.#privateProperty);
        console.log(this.#privateMethod());
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    tryToUseParentPrivate() {
        // These would cause errors if uncommented:
        // console.log(this.#privateProperty);
        // console.log(this.#privateMethod());
    }
}

const parent = new Parent();
const child = new Child();

parent.usePrivate();
// Output:
// I'm private
// This is a private method

// These would cause errors:
// console.log(parent.#privateProperty);
// console.log(parent.#privateMethod());
// child.tryToUseParentPrivate();
```

In this case:
- `#privateProperty` and `#privateMethod` are only accessible within Parent
- They're not accessible in Child, even though it extends Parent
- They're not accessible outside the class at all

#### Key Takeaways

1. Public members (default) are accessible everywhere.
2. Protected members (convention with `_`) are accessible within the class and subclasses, but shouldn't be accessed outside (though technically they can be).
3. Private members (with `#`) are only accessible within the defining class, not in subclasses or outside.
4. When using protected members, they behave like public members in terms of accessibility, but developers agree to treat them as if they were protected.
5. True privacy and encapsulation are only achieved with private members using the `#` syntax.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Static

The static keyword defines a static method or field for a class

A static method is a method that belongs to the class itself, not to any specific instance of the class.


```javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = Animal.capitalize(name);
    }

    static capitalize(name) {
        return name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);
    }

    walk() {
        console.log(`Animal ${this.name} is walking`);
    }
}

const animal = new Animal("lion");
animal.walk(); // Output: Animal Lion is walking

console.log(Animal.capitalize("elephant")); // Output: Elephant
```

Key points:
1. The `capitalize` method is declared as static using the `static` keyword.
2. It's called on the class (`Animal.capitalize`) not on instances.
3. It can be used inside the constructor or other methods using the class name.

### ‚≠ê Inheritance and Static Methods

Static methods are inherited by subclasses:

```javascript
class Human extends Animal {
    static greet() {
        console.log("Hello!");
    }
}

const human = new Human("john");
human.walk(); // Output: Animal John is walking

console.log(Human.capitalize("sarah")); // Output: Sarah
Human.greet(); // Output: Hello!
```

Note:
1. The `Human` class inherits the static `capitalize` method from `Animal`.
2. `Human` can also define its own static methods, like `greet`.

### ‚≠ê Calling Static Methods from Non-Static Methods

You can call static methods from non-static methods, but you need to use the class name:

```javascript
class Calculator {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    multiply(a, b) {
        // Using a static method in a non-static method
        return Calculator.add(a, 0) * b;
    }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
console.log(calc.multiply(3, 4)); // Output: 12
console.log(Calculator.add(5, 6)); // Output: 11
```

### ‚≠ê Static Methods vs. Instance Methods

Here's a comparison to illustrate the difference:

```javascript
class MyClass {
    static staticMethod() {
        return "I'm a static method";
    }

    instanceMethod() {
        return "I'm an instance method";
    }
}

console.log(MyClass.staticMethod()); // Output: I'm a static method

const obj = new MyClass();
console.log(obj.instanceMethod()); // Output: I'm an instance method

// This would throw an error:
// console.log(MyClass.instanceMethod());

// This would also throw an error:
// console.log(obj.staticMethod());
```

### ‚≠ê  Use Cases for Static Methods

1. **Utility Functions**: Methods that don't require object state.
2. **Factory Methods**: Creating instances with special properties.
3. **Cache or Fixed-Configuration**: Storing shared data for all instances.

Example of a factory method:

```javascript
class User {
    constructor(name, role) {
        this.name = name;
        this.role = role;
    }

    static createAdmin(name) {
        return new User(name, "admin");
    }
}

const admin = User.createAdmin("Alice");
console.log(admin.role); // Output: admin
```

### ‚≠ê Key Takeaways

1. Static methods are defined on the class, not instances.
2. They're called using the class name: `ClassName.methodName()`.
3. They can be inherited by subclasses.
4. They can't directly access instance properties or methods.
5. They're useful for utility functions, factory methods, and managing class-level data.
6. You can't call static methods on instances, and you can't call instance methods on the class.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getter & Setter


 Getters and setters are functions that allow you to get and set object values, respectively

```js
//getter setter
class human {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this._name = name;
    }
    get getName() {
        return this._name;
    }
    set setName(name) {
        this._name = name;
    }
}

const person = new human("", 0);
person.setName = "Raj";
person.setAge = 25;

console.log(person.getName);
console.log(person.getAge);

//Raj
//25
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è instanceOf Operator

 Check if an object is an instance of a class, subclass, or interface 

```js
//getter setter
class human {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    get getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
    set setName(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    get getAge() {
        return this.age;
    }
    set setAge(age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

const person = new human("", 0);
person.setName = "Raj";
person.setAge = 25;

console.log(person.getName);
console.log(person.getAge);

const person1 = "Subham"

console.log( person instanceof human)//true
console.log( person1 instanceof human)//false
```

It also returns true for subclass

```js
//getter setter
class human {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    get getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
    set setName(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    get getAge() {
        return this.age;
    }
    set setAge(age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Coder extends human {
    constructor(name, age, language) {
        super(name, age);
        this.language = language;
    }
}

const person = new human("", 0);
const subham = new Coder("subham", 22, "java");
person.setName = "Raj";
person.setAge = 25;


console.log( person instanceof human)
console.log( subham instanceof human)
```


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object

```js
class BankAccount {
    #balance; // Private field

    constructor(initialBalance) {
        this.#balance = initialBalance;
    }

    deposit(amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            this.#balance += amount;
        }
    }

    getBalance() {
        return this.#balance;
    }
}

const account = new BankAccount(1000);
account.deposit(500);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // 1500
// console.log(account.#balance); // Syntax error: private field
```


```js
//Encapsulation
const user = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 25,
    getAgeYear: function() {
        return new Date().getFullYear() - this.age;
    }
}
console.log(user.getAgeYear());
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.


```js
// Parent class
class Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

// Child classes
class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("The dog barks");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("The cat meows");
  }
}

// Function to demonstrate polymorphism
function animalSound(animal) {
  animal.makeSound();
}

// Usage
const animal = new Animal();
const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

animalSound(animal); // Output: The animal makes a sound
animalSound(dog); // Output: The dog barks
animalSound(cat); // Output: The cat meows
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.


```js
// Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

// Abstract class
class Vehicle {
    constructor(brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    // Abstract method
    start() {
        throw new Error("Method 'start()' must be implemented.");
    }

    getBrand() {
        return this.brand;
    }
}

// Concrete class
class Car extends Vehicle {
    start() {
        return `${this.brand} car is starting...`;
    }
}

// Usage
const myCar = new Car("Toyota");
console.log(myCar.getBrand()); // Output: Toyota
console.log(myCar.start());    // Output: Toyota car is starting...
```
### üß© Abstraction using Abstract Class - TypeScript

#### üîπ What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is the OOP principle of **hiding implementation details** and **exposing only essential features**.  
> Abstract classes help achieve abstraction by defining a **blueprint** for other classes.

---

#### üîπ Key Points
- Cannot instantiate an **abstract class** directly.
- Can contain:
  - ‚úÖ **Abstract methods** (no implementation) ‚Üí must be implemented in subclasses.
  - ‚úÖ **Concrete methods** (with implementation) ‚Üí reusable in subclasses.
- Can have constructors and properties.
- Supports access modifiers: `public`, `protected`, `private`.
- Promotes code **reusability** and **consistency**.

---

####üîπ Syntax Example

```typescript
abstract class Animal {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  abstract makeSound(): void; // must be implemented

  move(): void {               // shared behavior
    console.log(`${this.name} is moving`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Bark!");
  }
}
const dog = new Dog("Rocky");
dog.makeSound(); // Bark!
dog.move();      // Rocky is moving
```
‚úÖ Dog implements abstract method makeSound() while inheriting concrete method move().

### üß© Abstraction using Interface - TypeScript

#### üîπ What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is the OOP principle of **hiding implementation details** and **exposing only essential behavior**.  
> Interfaces achieve abstraction by defining a **contract** that classes or objects must follow.

---

#### üîπ Key Points
- Cannot instantiate an **interface** directly.
- Only defines **structure**: methods, properties, function types.
- Classes that implement the interface **must provide implementation** for all members.
- Supports **multiple inheritance** ‚Äî a class can implement multiple interfaces.
- Promotes **type safety**, **consistency**, and **clean design**.

---

#### üîπ Syntax Example

```typescript
interface Flyable {
  fly(): void;
}

interface Swimmable {
  swim(): void;
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
  fly(): void {
    console.log("Duck is flying");
  }
  swim(): void {
    console.log("Duck is swimming");
  }
}

const duck = new Duck();
duck.fly();  // Duck is flying
duck.swim(); // Duck is swimming
```
‚úÖ The Duck class implements multiple interfaces, providing concrete behavior while hiding internal logic.

### üß© Abstract Class vs Interface - TypeScript

#### üîπ Purpose
Both are used for **abstraction** in TypeScript, but they serve different needs:

- **Abstract Class:** Partial implementation + blueprint  
- **Interface:** Pure blueprint / contract (structure only)

---

#### üîπ Key Differences

| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Can have implementation | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Can define properties | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Only type definitions |
| Can have constructor | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Access modifiers | ‚úÖ public, protected, private | ‚ùå All members are public |
| Multiple inheritance | ‚ùå No (only extend one) | ‚úÖ Yes (implement multiple interfaces) |
| Use case | Shared logic + enforced structure | Contract or structure enforcement |

---

#### üîπ Example: Abstract Class

```typescript
abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void;
  move(): void { console.log("Moving..."); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void { console.log("Bark!"); }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.makeSound(); // Bark!
dog.move();      // Moving...
```
#### üîπ Example: Interface

```typescript
interface Flyable { fly(): void; }
interface Swimmable { swim(): void; }

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
  fly(): void { console.log("Flying"); }
  swim(): void { console.log("Swimming"); }
}

const duck = new Duck();
duck.fly();  // Flying
duck.swim(); // Swimming
```
üîπ Key Takeaways

Abstract Class: Use when you want shared logic + enforced methods

Interface: Use when you want pure abstraction / structure

A class can extend one abstract class and implement multiple interfaces

Helps design consistent, maintainable, and type-safe code

# üß© OOP Relationships

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), **relationships** define how classes and objects interact.

---

## üîπ 1. Inheritance (IS-A)
- One class **inherits** from another.
- Promotes **code reuse**.
  
```typescript
class Vehicle { move() { console.log("Vehicle moving"); } }
class Car extends Vehicle { drive() { console.log("Car driving"); } }
const car = new Car();
car.move();  // Vehicle moving
car.drive(); // Car driving
```

## üîπ 2. Composition / Aggregation (HAS-A)
- One class **contains another**.
- Promotes **modularity** and **code reuse**.
- Aggregation (HAS-A) Weak relation (Parent and child are loosely coupled)
- Composition (HAS-A) Strong (Child depends on the parent)

- Example : Composition
```typescript
class Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine started");
  }
}

class Car {
  engine = new Engine();
  
  startCar() {
    this.engine.start();
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.startCar(); // Engine started

-// ‚ùå The Engine cannot exist independently of Car in this example
-// Engine is created inside Car.
-// If Car is destroyed, the Engine is destroyed too.
```
- Example : Aggregation
```typescript
class Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine started");
  }
}

class Car {
  // Car **uses** an existing engine
  constructor(private engine: Engine) {}

  startCar() {
    this.engine.start();
  }
}

const engine = new Engine();  // Engine exists independently
const car = new Car(engine);  // Car aggregates Engine
car.startCar();               // Engine started

// Engine can still exist without Car
// Engine is created independently of Car.
// Car just uses or aggregates it.
// Shows looser coupling than Composition.
```
## üîπ 3. Association (USES-AS)
Represents a general connection between classes.
Can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
One class temporarily uses another class.
Promotes loose coupling.

```typescript
class Teacher {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
}

class Student {
  constructor(public name: string, public teacher: Teacher) {}
}

const teacher = new Teacher("Mr. Sharma");
const student = new Student("Riya", teacher);
```

# üß© Design Principle 

- Design Principles are guidelines that help developers build scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled software systems.
- They make code easier to understand, modify, and extend.

- üîπ 1. SOLID Principles
- üîπ 2. DRY
- üîπ 3. KISS
- üîπ 4. YAGNI
- üîπ 5. Composition over Inheritance 

Advance Design Principle

- üîπ 1. Law of Demeter
- üîπ 2. Design Patterns
- üîπ 3. Modularity
- üîπ 4. Separation of Concerns
- üîπ 5. Cohesion and Coupling

### üß© Design Principles vs Design Patterns

#### üîπ Application
- **Design Principles:** Guide the **overall design and architecture** of a system.  
- **Design Patterns:** Address **specific design problems and scenarios**.

---

#### üîπ Flexibility
- **Design Principles:** Broadly applicable across **various contexts and projects**.

| Purpose | Guide architecture and structure | Solve specific recurring problems |
| Scope | Broad and conceptual | Concrete and implementation-focused |
| Example | SOLID, DRY, KISS | Singleton, Observer, Factory, Strategy |
| Applicability | Throughout project lifecycle | Specific modules or use-cases |

---
## üß± S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### üìò Definition

A **class should have only one reason to change** ‚Äî it should handle **only one responsibility**.

---
### üí° Example

#### ‚ùå Wrong ‚Äî Handles both report generation and printing

```typescript
class Report {
  generate() {}
  print() {}
}
class Report {
  generate() {}
}

class ReportPrinter {
  print(report: Report) {}
}
-// ‚úÖ Benefit: Simplifies debugging, testing, and maintenance.
```

## üß± O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

### üìò Definition

A class should be **open for extension but closed for modification** 
Add new functionality by **extending**, not editing, existing code.

---

### üí° Example

```typescript
abstract class Shape {
  abstract area(): number;
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(private radius: number) { super(); }
  area() { return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2; }
}

class Square extends Shape {
  constructor(private side: number) { super(); }
  area() { return this.side ** 2; }
}

-// ‚úÖ Benefit: Easy to add new shapes without changing existing code.
```
## üß± L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### üìò Definition

Subclasses should be **substitutable for their parent classes** without breaking functionality.

---

### üí° Example

```typescript
class Bird { fly() {} }

class Duck extends Bird {}  // ‚úÖ Ok
class Penguin extends Bird { // ‚ùå Violates LSP ‚Äî can't fly
  fly() { throw new Error("Can't fly"); }
}

-// ‚úÖ Benefit: Ensures polymorphism works correctly.
```

## üß± I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

### üìò Definition

Clients should not be forced to depend on **interfaces they don‚Äôt use**.

---

### üí° Example

```typescript
// ‚ùå Too big interface
interface Worker {
  work(): void;
  eat(): void;
}

// ‚úÖ Split into smaller interfaces
interface Workable { work(): void; }
interface Eatable { eat(): void; }

class Robot implements Workable { work() {} }
class Human implements Workable, Eatable { work() {}; eat() {}; }

-// ‚úÖ Benefit: Ensures polymorphism works correctly.
```

## üß± D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should **not depend on low-level modules** ‚Äî both should depend on **abstractions** (interfaces).

---

### üí° Example
Before
```typescript
class PetrolEngine {
  start() {
    console.log("Petrol Engine started...");
  }
}

class Car {
  private engine: PetrolEngine;

  constructor() {
    this.engine = new PetrolEngine(); // ‚ùå Direct dependency on concrete class
  }

  start() {
    this.engine.start();
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.start();

-// Car is tightly coupled with PetrolEngine.
-// If we want to use a DieselEngine or ElectricEngine, we must modify the Car class.
```
After
```typescript
interface Engine {
  start(): void;
}

class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Petrol Engine started...");
  }
}

class DieselEngine implements Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Diesel Engine started...");
  }
}

class Car {
  constructor(private engine: Engine) {} // ‚úÖ Depends on abstraction, not concrete class

  start() {
    this.engine.start();
  }
}

const petrolCar = new Car(new PetrolEngine());
petrolCar.start();

const dieselCar = new Car(new DieselEngine());
dieselCar.start();
```

## üîπ 2. DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Avoid code duplication ‚Äî extract repeated logic into **functions or classes**.

## üîπ 3. KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Keep code simple and readable. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

## üîπ 4. YAGNI (You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It)

Don‚Äôt add functionality until it‚Äôs actually needed.

## üîπ 5. Composition over Inheritance

- Prefer object composition to reuse functionality instead of deep inheritance.
- Key Idea: Prefer "has-a" relationships (composition) over "is-a" relationships (inheritance) where appropriate.

```javascript
class Engine { start() { console.log("Engine started"); } }

class Car {
  constructor(private engine: Engine) {}
  start() { this.engine.start(); }
}
```
---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Law of Demeter (LoD)

### üìò Definition
Also known as the **‚ÄúPrinciple of Least Knowledge‚Äù**,  
the **Law of Demeter** states that:

> A module (or class) should have **limited knowledge** about other modules.  
> It should **only talk to its immediate friends**, not strangers.

---

### üö´ Avoid ‚ÄúMethod Chaining‚Äù on Other Objects
A class should **not** navigate through multiple objects to access a method or property.

---

### ‚ùå Bad Example ‚Äî Violating LoD

```typescript
class Engine {
  getPiston() {
    return new Piston();
  }
}

class Piston {
  move() {
    console.log("Piston moving...");
  }
}

class Car {
  constructor(private engine: Engine) {}

  start() {
    // ‚ùå Car is directly accessing Piston through Engine ‚Äî too much knowledge
    this.engine.getPiston().move();
  }
}

const car = new Car(new Engine());
car.start();

- // Car knows too much about Engine‚Äôs internal structure.
- // If the internal design of Engine changes, Car must also change.\
- // This breaks encapsulation and increases coupling.
```
### ‚úÖ Good Example ‚Äî Following LoD

```javascript
class Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine started...");
  }
}

class Car {
  constructor(private engine: Engine) {}

  start() {
    // ‚úÖ Car only talks to Engine (its direct friend)
    this.engine.start();
  }
}

const car = new Car(new Engine());
car.start();

- // ‚úÖ Car only interacts with Engine, not with its internal components.
```

## Modularity 

Modularity refers to the design principle of breaking a system into smaller,
self-contained units (modules) that can be developed, tested, and maintained
independently. 

## Separation of concerns

A design principle for organizing code such that different concerns or
responsibilities are separated into distinct modules or layers. 

## üîó Loose Coupling vs Tight Coupling

### üìò Definition
**Coupling** refers to the level of dependency between different modules, classes, or components in a system.  
The **goal** in software design is to achieve **Loose Coupling** ‚Äî where modules are independent, flexible, and reusable.

---

### üß© Loose Coupling

### üîπ Description
- Modules are **minimally dependent** on each other.  
- **Changes** in one module **do not affect** others.  
- Achieved using **abstraction**, **interfaces**, and **dependency injection**.  
- Common in **modular**, **microservice**, or **layered architectures**.

---

### ‚úÖ Example ‚Äî Loose Coupling in TypeScript

```typescript
// Abstraction
interface Engine {
  start(): void;
}

// Concrete Implementations
class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Petrol Engine started...");
  }
}

class DieselEngine implements Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Diesel Engine started...");
  }
}

// High-level module depends on abstraction, not implementation
class Car {
  constructor(private engine: Engine) {}

  start() {
    this.engine.start();
  }
}

const petrolCar = new Car(new PetrolEngine());
petrolCar.start();

const dieselCar = new Car(new DieselEngine());
dieselCar.start();
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Tight Coupling

### üîπ Description
- Modules are highly dependent on one another.
- Any change in one module can break others.
- Harder to test, maintain, or reuse components.
- Common in monolithic systems or legacy codebases.

---

### ‚ùå Example ‚Äî Tight Coupling in TypeScript

```typescript
class PetrolEngine {
  start() {
    console.log("Petrol Engine started...");
  }
}

class Car {
  private engine: PetrolEngine;

  constructor() {
    this.engine = new PetrolEngine(); // ‚ùå Direct dependency
  }

  start() {
    this.engine.start();
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.start();
```

> ‚úÖ Best Practice: Always design for Loose Coupling to build scalable, flexible, and maintainable systems.

## Tight Cohesion

- Cohesion refers to how **closely related the responsibilities of a module** are.

### Examples of Tight Cohesion

#### Tight Cohesion:
  - A class handling only user authentication.
#### Low Cohesion:
  - A class managing user authentication, payment processing, and email notifications.

> ‚úÖ  Tip: Follow the Single Responsibility Principle SRP.
